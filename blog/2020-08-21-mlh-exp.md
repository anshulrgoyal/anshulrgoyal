MLH fellowship is a program run by Major League Hacking. It helps students to contribute to open-source by providing a mentor. Fellows are in regular contact with Maintainers. A small education stipend is also provided.

## My Major League Hacking Experience
I am an introvert so I didn't possess good communication skills. Major League Hacking helped me hack people and improve my communications. Daily stands up, mentor one on one and show n tells helped me put more context in my conversations. I learned a lot during the fellowship.

## Project Details
I worked on [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/). It is a static documentation site generator by Facebook. It is like gatsby but for documentation. It has built-in support versioning and themes.

I mostly worked on Migration CLI, validation of various aspects of docusaurus.config.js, swizzle command, and remark plugins for loading image assets and other assets.

## Conclusion
MLH Fellowship is the best thing that happened this year. It is a very good opportunity for students and I highly recommend it. I thank MLh and Github education for this wonderful effort.
